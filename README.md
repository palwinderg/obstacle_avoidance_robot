# obstacle_avoidance_robot

This repository conatains the source code used for the Arduino

The source code is in the .ino file

The source code is meant to work with two motors on either side of the robot.
I used  the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance from the robot to any obstacle.
I also used a L293D chip to control the motor speed and direction.
Good Luck!
